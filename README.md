# Error related to serving Media files

* It can be simulated on speaker based devices like Google Home Mini and surface based devices like smart displays. But it works fine on Android devices.

* In this error, the action speaks the intended repsonse followed by **Sorry, something went wrong. When you're ready, give it another try.** and then starts playing the media files.

* This is a very minimal example to simulate this error.

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and NPM
    + We recommend installing using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://developers.google.com/actions/dialogflow/deploy-fulfillment)
    + We recommend using version 6.5.0, `npm install -g firebase-tools@6.5.0`
    + Run `firebase login` with your Google account

### Configuration
#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), New project (this will become your *Project ID*) > **Create project** > under **More options** > **Conversational**.
1. From the top menu under **Develop** > **Actions** (left nav) > **Add your first action** > **BUILD** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. In the Dialogflow console, go to **Settings** ⚙ > **Export and Import** > **Restore from zip**.
1. Follow the directions to restore from the `agent.zip` in this sample's `dialogflow` directory.

#### Firebase Deployment
1. On your local machine, in the `functions` directory, run `npm install`.
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID}` to deploy the function
    + To find your **Project ID**: In [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com/) under **Settings** ⚙ > **General** tab > **Project ID**.

#### Dialogflow Console
1. Return to the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com) > select **Fulfillment** > **Enable** Webhook > Set **URL** to the **Function URL** that was returned after the deploy command > **SAVE**.
    ```
    Function URL (dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment
    ```
1. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator then say or type `Talk to my test app`.

### Running this Sample
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to <your invocation name>”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.
